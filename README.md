🎯 Purpose of the Project

This project is designed to:

Help students understand how sorting algorithms work internally

Improve visualization of algorithm efficiency

Compare performance between different sorting techniques

📊 How It Works

A random array is generated.

A sorting algorithm is selected.

The algorithm runs step-by-step.

The changes in the array are visualized dynamically.
